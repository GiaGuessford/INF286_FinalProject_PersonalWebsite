        <p>Hello! My name is Gia Guessford, and I am a designer specializing in football and other media featuring athletics. I focus on creating realistic artwork, bringing to life players and mascots from scratch. My goal, while working on each design, is to capture the essence and details of the sports world through dynamic illustrations and posters.</p>
        <p>In addition to my flair for design, I am also a music lover and a musician, myself. I play the electric bass and have been fortunate to play in several bands throughout my life. Music enhances my ability to create and adds unique layers to my artistic expression. Listening to and playing music helps me to connect with an even larger audience.</p>
        <p>I come from a close-knit family of five. Growing up the youngest with two older brothers has helped shape who I am. Outside of my work and hobbies, I’m also an animal lover and have two amazing dogs that bring so much life, energy, and funny stories to share.</p>
        <p>I am currently majoring in 3D Digital Design with a minor in Honors. My studies have given me the opportunity to explore many diverse and creative avenues, especially within digital media and design world. Through my learning, I have been able grow as both a person and a designer. The combination of design, technology, and music continues to inspire me every day and I’m excited to see where these paths will take me..</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to sharing my work and experiences with you!</p>
